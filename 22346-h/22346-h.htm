<h1>EXILE</h1>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 175%;">BY H. B. FYFE</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 125%;">ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
who did land there, there was no returning&mdash;only
the bitterness of respect&mdash;and justice!</p></div>

<p>The Tepoktan student, whose
blue robe in George Kinton's
opinion clashed with the dull
purple of his scales, twiddled a
three-clawed hand for attention.
Kinton nodded to him from his
place on the dais before the
group.</p>

<p>"Then you can give us no precise
count of the stars in the
galaxy, George?"</p>

<p>Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
a wrinkled hand through his
graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
speech, his name came
out more like "Chortch."</p>

<p>Questions like this had been
put to him often during the ten
years since his rocket had
hurtled through the meteorite
belt and down to the surface of
Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
Barred off as they were
from venturing into space, the
highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
displayed the curiosity of
dreamers in matters related to
the universe. Because of the veil
of meteorites and satellite fragments
whirling about their
planet, their astronomers had acquired
torturous skills but only
scraps of real knowledge.</p>

<p>"As I believe I mentioned in
some of my recorded lectures,"
Kinton answered in their language,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
"the number is actually
as vast as it seems to those of
you peering through the Dome
of Eyes. The scientists of my
race have not yet encountered
any beings capable of estimating
the total."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:417px;">
<img src="images/img01.png" width="417" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He leaned back and scanned
the faces of his interviewers,
faces that would have been oddly
humanoid were it not for the
elongated snouts and pointed,
sharp-toothed jaws. The average
Tepoktan was slightly under
Kinton's height of five-feet-ten,
with a long, supple trunk. Under
the robes their scholars affected,
the shortness of their two bowed
legs was not obvious; but the
sight of the short, thick arms
carried high before their chests
still left Kinton with a feeling
of misproportion.</p>

<p>He should be used to it after
ten years, he thought, but even
the reds or purples of the scales
or the big teeth seemed more
natural.</p>

<p>"I sympathize with your curiosity,"
he added. "It is a marvel
that your scientists have
managed to measure the distances
of so many stars."</p>

<p>He could tell that they were
pleased by his admiration, and
wondered yet again why any
little show of approval by him
was so eagerly received. Even
though he was the first stellar
visitor in their recorded history,
Kinton remained conscious of the
fact that in many fields he was
unable to offer the Tepoktans any
new ideas. In one or two ways,
he believed, no Terran could
teach their experts anything.</p>

<p>"Then will you tell us, George,
more about the problems of your
first space explorers?" came another
question.</p>

<p class="tb">Before Kinton had formed his
answer, the golden curtains at
the rear of the austerely simple
chamber parted. Klaft, the Tepoktan
serving the current year
as Kinton's chief aide, hurried
toward the dais. The twenty-odd
members of the group fell silent
on their polished stone benches,
turning their pointed visages to
follow Klaft's progress.</p>

<p>The aide reached Kinton and
bent to hiss and cluck into the
latter's ear in what he presumably
considered an undertone.
The Terran laboriously spelled
out the message inscribed on the
limp, satiny paper held before his
eyes. Then he rose and took one
step toward the waiting group.</p>

<p>"I regret I shall have to conclude
this discussion," he announced.
"I am informed that
another ship from space has
reached the surface of Tepokt.
My presence is requested in case
the crew are of my own planet."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Klaft excitedly skipped down
to lead the way up the aisle, but
Kinton hesitated. Those in the
audience were scholars or officials
to whom attendance at one
of Kinton's limited number of
personal lectures was awarded as
an honor.</p>

<p>They would hardly learn anything
from him directly that was
not available in recordings made
over the course of years. The
Tepoktan scientists, historians,
and philosophers had respectfully
but eagerly gathered every
crumb of information Kinton
knowingly had to offer&mdash;and
some he thought he had forgotten.
Still ... he sensed the disappointment
at his announcement.</p>

<p>"I shall arrange for you to
await my return here in town,"
Kinton said, and there were murmurs
of pleasure.</p>

<p>Later, aboard the jet helicopter
that was basically like
those Kinton remembered using
on Terra twenty light years
away, he shook his head at
Klaft's respectful protest.</p>

<p>"But George! It was enough
that they were present when you
received the news. They can talk
about that the rest of their lives!
You must not waste your
strength on these people who
come out of curiosity."</p>

<p>Kinton smiled at his aide's
earnest concern. Then he turned
to look out the window as he recalled
the shadow that underlay
such remonstrances. He estimated
that he was about forty-eight
now, as nearly as he could tell
from the somewhat longer revolutions
of Tepokt. The time
would come when he would age
and die. Whose wishes would
then prevail?</p>

<p>Maybe he was wrong, he
thought. Maybe he shouldn't
stand in the way of their biologists
and surgeons. But he'd
rather be buried, even if that
left them with only what he
could tell them about the human
body.</p>

<p class="tb">To help himself forget the
rather preoccupied manner in
which some of the Tepoktan scientists
occasionally eyed him, he
peered down at the big dam of
the hydro-electric project being
completed to Kinton's design.
Power from this would soon
light the town built to house the
staff of scientists, students, and
workers assigned to the institute
organized about the person
of Kinton.</p>

<p>Now, there was an example of
their willingness to repay him
for whatever help he had been,
he reflected. They hadn't needed
that for themselves.</p>

<p>In some ways, compared to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
those of Terra, the industries of
Tepokt were underdeveloped. In
the first place, the population
was smaller and had different
standards of luxury. In the second,
a certain lack of drive resulted
from the inability to
break out into interplanetary
space. Kinton had been inexplicably
lucky to have reached the
surface even in a battered hulk.
The shell of meteorites was at
least a hundred miles thick and
constantly shifting.</p>

<p>"We do not know if they have
always been meteorites," the
Tepoktans had told Kinton, "or
whether part of them come from
a destroyed satellite; but our observers
have proved mathematically
that no direct path through
them may be predicted more than
a very short while in advance."</p>

<p>Kinton turned away from the
window as he caught the glint
of Tepokt's sun upon the hull of
the spaceship they had also built
for him. Perhaps ... would it
be fair to encourage the newcomer
to attempt the barrier?</p>

<p>For ten years, Kinton had
failed to work up any strong desire
to try it. The Tepoktans
called the ever-shifting lights
the Dome of Eyes, after a myth
in which each tiny satellite
bright enough to be visible was
supposed to watch over a single
individual on the surface. Like
their brothers on Terra, the native
astronomers could trace
their science back to a form of
astrology; and Kinton often told
them jokingly that he felt no
urge to risk a physical encounter
with his own personal Eye.</p>

<p class="tb">The helicopter started to descend,
and Kinton remembered
that the city named in his message
was only about twenty miles
from his home. The brief twilight
of Tepokt was passing by
the time he set foot on the landing
field, and he paused to look
up.</p>

<p>The brighter stars visible from
this part of the planet twinkled
back at him, and he knew that
each was being scrutinized by
some amateur or professional
astronomer. Before an hour had
elapsed, most of them would be
obscured by the tiny moonlets,
some of which could already be
seen. These could easily be mistaken
for stars or the other five
planets of the system, but in a
short while the tinier ones in
groups would cause a celestial
haze resembling a miniature
Milky Way.</p>

<p>Klaft, who had descended first,
leaving the pilot to bring up the
rear, noticed Kinton's pause.</p>

<p>"Glory glitters till it is known
for a curse," he remarked, quoting
a Tepoktan proverb often applied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
by the disgruntled scientists
to the Dome of Eyes.</p>

<p>Kinton observed, however,
that his aide also stared upward
for a long moment. The Tepoktans
loved speculating about the
unsolvable. They had even founded
clubs to argue whether two
satellites had been destroyed or
only one.</p>

<p>Half a dozen officials hastened
up to escort the party to the
vehicle awaiting Kinton. Klaft
succeeded in quieting the lesser
members of the delegation so
that Kinton was able to learn a
few facts about the new arrival.
The crash had been several hundred
miles away, but someone
had thought of the hospital in
this city which was known to
have a doctor rating as an expert
in human physiology. The survivor&mdash;only
one occupant of the
wreck, alive or dead, had
been discovered&mdash;had accordingly
been flown here.</p>

<p>With a clanging of bells, the
little convoy of ground cars
drew up in front of the hospital.
A way was made through the
chittering crowd around the
entrance. Within a few minutes,
Kinton found himself looking
down at a pallet upon which lay
another Terran.</p>

<p>A man! he thought, then
curled a lip wrily at the sudden,
unexpected pang of disappointment.
Well, he hadn't realized
until then what he was really
hoping for!</p>

<p class="tb">The spaceman had been
cleaned up and bandaged by the
native medicos. Kinton saw that
his left thigh was probably
broken. Other dressings suggested
cracked ribs and lacerations
on the head and shoulders. The
man was dark-haired but pale of
skin, with a jutting chin and a
nose that had been flattened in
some earlier mishap. The flaring
set of his ears somehow emphasized
an overall leanness. Even in
sleep, his mouth was thin and
hard.</p>

<p>"Thrown across the controls
after his belt broke loose?" Kinton
guessed.</p>

<p>"I bow to your wisdom,
George," said the plump Tepoktan
doctor who appeared to be
in charge.</p>

<p>Kinton could not remember
him, but everyone on the planet
addressed the Terran by the
sound they fondly thought to be
his first name.</p>

<p>"This is Doctor Chuxolkhee,"
murmured Klaft.</p>

<p>Kinton made the accepted gesture
of greeting with one hand
and said, "You seem to have
treated him very expertly."</p>

<p>Chuxolkhee ruffled the scales
around his neck with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>"I have studied Terran physiology,"
he admitted complacently.
"From your records and
drawings, of course, George, for
I have not yet had the good fortune
to visit you."</p>

<p>"We must arrange a visit
soon," said Kinton. "Klaft
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off at the sound from
the patient.</p>

<p>"A Terran!" mumbled the injured
man.</p>

<p>He shook his head dazedly,
tried to sit up, and subsided with
a groan.</p>

<p><i>Why, he looked scared when
he saw me</i>, thought Kinton.</p>

<p>"You're all right now," he said
soothingly. "It's all over and
you're in good hands. I gather
there were no other survivors of
the crash?"</p>

<p>The man stared curiously. Kinton
realized that his own language
sputtered clumsily from
his lips after ten years. He tried
again.</p>

<p>"My name is George Kinton.
I don't blame you if I'm hard to
understand. You see, I've been
here ten years without ever having
another Terran to speak to."</p>

<p>The spaceman considered that
for a few breaths, then seemed
to relax.</p>

<p>"Al Birken," he introduced
himself laconically. "Ten years?"</p>

<p>"A little over," confirmed Kinton.
"It's extremely unusual that
anything gets through to the
surface, let alone a spaceship.
What happened to you?"</p>

<p class="tb">Birken's stare was suspicious.</p>

<p>"Then you ain't heard about
the new colonies? Naw&mdash;you
musta come here when all the
planets were open."</p>

<p>"We had a small settlement on
the second planet," Kinton told
him. "You mean there are new
Terran colonies?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Jet-hoppers spreadin'
all over the other five. None of
the land-hungry poops figured a
way to set down here, though, or
they'd be creepin' around this
planet too."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to do
it? Run out of fuel?"</p>

<p>The other eyed him for a few
seconds before dropping his
gaze. Kinton was struck with
sudden doubt. The outposts of
civilization were followed by less
desirable developments as a general
rule&mdash;prisons, for instance.
He resolved to be wary of the
visitor.</p>

<p>"Ya might say I was explorin',"
Birken replied at last.
"That's why I come alone.
Didn't want nobody else hurt if
I didn't make it. Say, how bad
am I banged up?"</p>

<p>Kinton realized guiltily that
the man should be resting. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had lost track of the moments
he had wasted in talk while the
others with him stood attentively
about.</p>

<p>He questioned the doctor briefly
and relayed the information
that Birken's leg was broken but
that the other injuries were not
serious.</p>

<p>"They'll fix you up," he assured
the spaceman. "They're
quite good at it, even if the sight
of one does make you think a
little of an iguana. Rest up, now;
and I'll come back again when
you're feeling better."</p>

<p>For the next three weeks, Kinton
flew back and forth from his
own town nearly every day. He
felt that he should not neglect
the few meetings which were the
only way he could repay the Tepoktans
for all they did for him.
On the other hand, the chance
to see and talk with one of his
own kind drew him like a magnet
to the hospital.</p>

<p>The doctors operated upon
Birken's leg, inserting a metal
rod inside the bone by a method
they had known before Kinton
described it. The new arrival expected
to be able to walk, with
care, almost any day; although
the pin would have to be removed
after the bone had healed. Meanwhile,
Birken seemed eager to
learn all Kinton could tell him
about the planet, Tepokt.</p>

<p>About himself, he was remarkably
reticent. Kinton worried
about this.</p>

<p>"I think we should not expect
too much of this Terran," he
warned Klaft uneasily. "You,
too, have citizens who do not always
obey, your laws, who sometimes
... that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are born to die under
the axe, as we say," interrupted
Klaft, as if to ease the concern
plain on Kinton's face. "In other
words, criminals. You suspect
this Albirken is such a one,
George?"</p>

<p>"It is not impossible," admitted
Kinton unhappily. "He will
tell me little about himself. It
may be that he was caught in
Tepokt's gravity while fleeing
from justice."</p>

<p>To himself, he wished he had
not told Birken about the spaceship.
He didn't think the man
exactly believed his explanation
of why there was no use taking
off in it.</p>

<p class="tb">Yet he continued to spend as
much time as he could visiting
the other man. Then, as his helicopter
landed at the city airport
one gray dawn, the news reached
him.</p>

<p>"The other Terran has gone,"
Klaft reported, turning from the
breathless messenger as Kinton
followed him from the machine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>"Gone? Where did they take
him?"</p>

<p>Klaft looked uneasy, embarrassed.
Kinton repeated his question,
wondering about the group
of armed police on hand.</p>

<p>"In the night," Klaft hissed
and clucked, "when none would
think to watch him, they tell me
... and quite rightly, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get on with it, Klaft!
Please!"</p>

<p>"In the night, then, Albirken
left the chamber in which he lay.
He can walk some now, you
know, because of Dr. Chuxolkhee's
metal pin. He&mdash;he stole a
ground car and is gone."</p>

<p>"He did?" Kinton had an
empty feeling in the pit of his
stomach. "Is it known where he
went? I mean ... he has been
curious to see some of Tepokt.
Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, his own words
braying in his ears. Klaft was
clicking two claws together, a
sign of emphatic disagreement.</p>

<p>"Albirken," he said, "was soon
followed by three police constables
in another vehicle. They
found him heading in the direction
of our town."</p>

<p>"Why did he say he was traveling
that way?" asked Kinton,
thinking to himself of the spaceship!
Was the man crazy?</p>

<p>"He did not say," answered
Klaft expressionlessly. "Taking
them by surprise, he killed two
of the constables and injured
the third before fleeing with one
of their spears."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>Kinton felt his eyes bulging
with dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, for they carried only the
short spears of their authority,
not expecting to need fire weapons."</p>

<p class="tb">Kinton looked from him to the
messenger, noticing for the first
time that the latter was an under-officer
of police. He shook his
head distractedly. It appeared
that his suspicions concerning
Birken had been only too accurate.</p>

<p>Why was it one like him who
got through? he asked himself
in silent anguish. After ten
years. The Tepoktans had been
thinking well of Terrans, but
now&mdash;</p>

<p>He did not worry about his
own position. That was well
enough established, whether or
not he could again hold up his
head before the purple-scaled
people who had been so generous
to him.</p>

<p>Even if they had been aroused
to a rage by the killing, Kinton
told himself, he would not have
been concerned about himself. He
had reached a fairly ripe age for
a spaceman. In fact, he had already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
enjoyed a decade of borrowed
time.</p>

<p>But they were more civilized
than that wanton murderer, he
realized.</p>

<p>He straightened up, forcing
back his early-morning weariness.</p>

<p>"We must get into the air
immediately," he told Klaft.
"Perhaps we may see him before
he reaches&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off at the word
"spaceship" but he noticed a reserved
expression on Klaft's
pointed face. His aide had probably
reached a conclusion similar
to his own.</p>

<p>They climbed back into the
cabin and Klaft gave brisk orders
to the lean young pilot. A
moment later, Kinton saw the
ground outside drop away.</p>

<p>Only upon turning around did
he realize that two armed Tepoktans
had materialized in time to
follow Klaft inside.</p>

<p>One was a constable but the
other he recognized for an officer
of some rank. Both wore slung
across their chests weapons resembling
long-barreled pistols
with large, oddly indented butts
to fit Tepoktan claws. The constable,
in addition, carried a
contraption with a quadruple
tube for launching tiny rockets
no thicker than Kinton's thumb.
These, he knew, were loaded
with an explosive worthy of respect
on any planet he had heard
of.</p>

<p>To protect him, he wondered.
Or to get Birken?</p>

<p>The pilot headed the craft
back toward Kinton's town in
the brightening sky of early day.
Long before the buildings of
Kinton's institute came into
view, they received a radio message
about Birken.</p>

<p>"He has been seen on the road
passing the dam," Klaft reported
soberly after having been called
to the pilot's compartment. "He
stopped to demand fuel from
some maintenance workers, but
they had been warned and fled."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they have seized
him?" demanded Kinton, his tone
sharp with the worry he endeavored
to control. "He has that
spear, I suppose; but he is only
one and injured."</p>

<p>Klaft hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't they?"</p>

<p>The aide looked away, out one
of the windows at some sun-dyed
clouds ranging from pink
to orange. He grimaced and
clicked his showy teeth uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they thought you
might be offended, George," he
answered at last.</p>

<p>Kinton settled back in the seat
especially padded to fit the contours
of his Terran body, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
stared silently at the partition
behind the pilot.</p>

<p>In other words, he thought, he
was responsible for Birken, who
was a Terran, one of his own
kind. Maybe they really didn't
want to risk hurting his feelings,
but that was only part of it.
They were leaving it up to him
to handle what they considered
his private affair.</p>

<p>He wondered what to do. He
had no actual faith in the idea
that Birken was delirious, or acting
under any influence but that
of a criminally self-centered nature.</p>

<p>"I <i>shouldn't</i> have told him
about the ship!" Kinton muttered,
gnawing the knuckle of
his left thumb. "He's on the run,
all right. Probably scared the
colonial authorities will trail him
right down through the Dome of
Eyes. Wonder what he did?"</p>

<p>He caught himself and looked
around to see if he had been overheard.
Klaft and the police officers
peered from their respective
windows, in calculated withdrawal.
Kinton, disturbed, tried
to remember whether he had
spoken in Terran or Tepoktan.</p>

<p>Would Birken listen if he tried
reasoning, he asked himself.
Maybe if he showed the man how
they had proved the unpredictability
of openings through the
shifting Dome of Eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>An exclamation from the constable
drew his attention. He
rose, and room was made for him
at the opposite window.</p>

<p class="tb">In the distance, beyond the
town landing field they were now
approaching, Kinton saw a halted
ground car. Across the plain
which was colored a yellowish
tan by a short, grass-like growth,
a lone figure plodded toward the
upthrust bulk of the spaceship
that had never flown.</p>

<p>"Never mind landing at the
town!" snapped Kinton. "Go directly
out to the ship!"</p>

<p>Klaft relayed the command to
the pilot. The helicopter swept
in a descending curve across the
plain toward the gleaming hull.</p>

<p>As they passed the man below,
Birken looked up. He continued
to limp along at a brisk
pace with the aid of what looked
like a short spear.</p>

<p>"Go down!" Kinton ordered.</p>

<p>The pilot landed about a hundred
yards from the spaceship.
By the time his passengers had
alighted, however, Birken had
drawn level with them, about
fifty feet away.</p>

<p>"Birken!" shouted Kinton.
"Where do you think you're going?"</p>

<p>Seeing that no one ran after
him, Birken slowed his pace, but
kept walking toward the ship.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
He watched them over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Kinton," he shouted
with no noticeable tone of regret.
"I figure I better travel on for
my health."</p>

<p>"It's not so damn healthy up
there!" called Kinton. "I told
you how there's no clear path&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, you told me. That
don't mean I gotta believe it."</p>

<p>"Wait! Don't you think they
tried sending unmanned rockets
up? Every one was struck and
exploded."</p>

<p>Birken showed no more change
of expression than if the other
had commented on the weather.</p>

<p>Kinton had stepped forward
six or eight paces, irritated despite
his anxiety at the way Birken
persisted in drifting before
him.</p>

<p>Kinton couldn't just grab him&mdash;bad
leg or not, he could probably
break the older man in two.</p>

<p>He glanced back at the Tepoktans
beside the helicopter, Klaft,
the pilot, the officer, the constable
with the rocket weapon.</p>

<p>They stood quietly, looking
back at him.</p>

<p>The call for help that had risen
to his lips died there.</p>

<p>"Not <i>their</i> party," he muttered.
He turned again to Birken,
who still retreated toward the
ship. "But he'll only get himself
killed <i>and</i> destroy the ship! Or
if some miracle gets him
through, that's worse! He's
nothing to turn loose on a civilized
colony again."</p>

<p class="tb">A twinge of shame tugged
down the corners of his mouth
as he realized that keeping Birken
here would also expose a
highly cultured people to an unscrupulous
criminal who had already
committed murder the very
first time he had been crossed.</p>

<p>"Birken!" he shouted. "For
the last time! Do you want me
to send them to drag you back
here?"</p>

<p>Birken stopped at that. He regarded
the motionless Tepoktans
with a derisive sneer.</p>

<p>"They don't look too eager to
me," he taunted.</p>

<p>Kinton growled a Tepoktan expression
the meaning of which
he had deduced after hearing it
used by the dam workers.</p>

<p>He whirled to run toward the
helicopter. Hardly had he taken
two steps, however, when he saw
startled changes in the carefully
blank looks of his escort. The
constable half raised his heavy
weapon, and Klaft sprang forward
with a hissing cry.</p>

<p>By the time Kinton's aging
muscles obeyed his impulse to
sidestep, the spear had already
hurtled past. It had missed him
by an error of over six feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>He felt his face flushing with
sudden anger. Birken was running
as best he could toward the
spaceship, and had covered nearly
half the distance.</p>

<p>Kinton ran at the Tepoktans,
brushing aside the concerned
Klaft. He snatched the heavy
weapon from the surprised constable.</p>

<p>He turned and raised it to his
chest. Because of the shortness
of Tepoktan arms, the launcher
was constructed so that the butt
rested against the chest with the
sighting loops before the eyes.
The little rocket tubes were
above head height, to prevent the
handler's catching the blast.</p>

<p>The circles of the sights
weaved and danced about the
running figure. Kinton realized
to his surprise that the effort of
seizing the weapon had him panting.
Or was it the fright at having
a spear thrown at him? He
decided that Birken had not come
close enough for that, and wondered
if he was afraid of his
own impending action.</p>

<p>It wasn't fair, he complained
to himself. The poor slob only
had a spear, and a man couldn't
blame him for wanting to get
back to his own sort. He was
limping ... hurt ... how could
they expect him to realize&mdash;?</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, his lips tightened
to a thin line. The sights
steadied on Birken as the latter
approached the foot of the ladder
leading to the entrance port
of the spaceship.</p>

<p>Kinton pressed the firing stud.</p>

<p>Across the hundred-yard space
streaked four flaring little projectiles.
Kinton, without exactly
seeing each, was aware of the
general lines of flight diverging
gradually to bracket the figure
of Birken.</p>

<p>One struck the ground beside
the man just as he set one foot
on the bottom rung of the ladder,
and skittered away past one fin
of the ship before exploding.
Two others burst against the
hull, scattering metal fragments,
and another puffed on the upright
of the ladder just above
Birken's head.</p>

<p class="tb">The spaceman was blown back
from the ladder. He balanced on
his heels for a moment with outstretched
fingers reaching toward
the grips from which they
had been torn. Then he crumpled
into a limp huddle on the yellowing
turf.</p>

<p>Kinton sighed.</p>

<p>The constable took the weapon
from him, reloaded deftly, and
proffered it again. When the
Terran did not reach for it, the
officer held out a clawed hand to
receive it. He gestured silently,
and the constable trotted across
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the intervening ground to bend
over Birken.</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Klaft when
the constable straightened up
with a curt wave.</p>

<p>"Will ... will you have someone
see to him, please?" Kinton
requested, turning toward the
helicopter.</p>

<p>"Yes, George," said Klaft.
"George...?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It would be very instructive&mdash;that
is, I believe Dr. Chuxolkhee
would like to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right!" yielded Kinton,
surprised at the harshness of his
own voice. "Just tell him not to
bring around any sketches of the
various organs for a few
months!"</p>

<p>He climbed into the helicopter
and slumped into his seat. Presently,
he was aware of Klaft edging
into the seat across the aisle.
He looked up.</p>

<p>"The police will stay until cars
from town arrive. They are coming
now," said his aide.</p>

<p class="tb">Kinton stared at his hands,
wondering at the fact that they
were not shaking. He felt dejected,
empty, not like a man who
had just been at a high pitch of
excitement.</p>

<p>"Why did you not let him go,
George?"</p>

<p>"What? Why ... why ... he
would have destroyed the ship
you worked so hard to build.
There is no safe path through
the Dome of Eyes."</p>

<p>"No predictable path," Klaft
corrected. "But what then? We
would have built you another
ship, George, for it was you who
showed us how."</p>

<p>Kinton flexed his fingers
slowly.</p>

<p>"He was just no good. You
know the murder he did here;
we can only guess what he did
among my own ... among Terrans.
Should he have a chance to
go back and commit more
crimes?"</p>

<p>"I understand, George, the
logic of it," said Klaft. "I meant
... it is not my place to say this
... but you seem unhappy."</p>

<p>"Possibly," grunted Kinton
wrily.</p>

<p>"We, too, have criminals," said
the aide, as gently as was possible
in his clicking language.
"We do not think it necessary
to grieve for the pain they bring
upon themselves."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," sighed
Kinton. "I ... it's just&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked up at the pointed
visage, at the strange eyes regarding
him sympathetically
from beneath the sloping, purple-scaled
forehead.</p>

<p>"It's just that now I'm lonely
... again," he said.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
